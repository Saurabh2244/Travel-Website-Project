# Travel-Website-Project

I developed a responsive and user-friendly tours and travel website using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. The project utilized CSS display flex and other CSS properties effectively. It incorporated several JavaScript functionalities, including a sticky navbar, text and image sliders, form validation, countdown timer, scrolling events, and search functionality.
